#Back End Web Development - Cohort 10 

At the beginning of class, pull the latest changes from this repo down to your `bewd_sf_10` directory in terminal.    

The remotes  (`git remote -v` to check) to this repository should look like this:   
 
    origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bewd_sf_10 (fetch)    
    origin	https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/bewd_sf_10 (push)    
    upstream	https://github.com/ga-students/bewd_sf_10 (fetch)    
    upstream	https://github.com/ga-students/bewd_sf_10 (push)

The origin and upstream remote names are nicknames for your Github repository urls so you can easily push and pull.    
 
From your master branch (`git branch`) in `bewd_sf_10` directory, pull from upstream with `git pull upstream master`. You can `ls` to list the new files you've pulled in.
